# SAF-Argumentation
Logic-based argumentation framework with collective attacks. We are building a new Darg system to allow human-AI interactions, in which it allows users to query and receive explanatory dialogue about why the query is (not) accepted under certain/ credulous/ grounded semantics. The Darg system is built based on the SAF framework. At the first step of building the Darg system, we provide a graphical representation of explanatory dialogues, i.e., dialogue trees.

# Status
