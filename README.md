# SAF-Argumentation
Logic-based argumentation framework with collective attacks. We are building a new Darg system to allow human-AI interactions, in which it allows users to query and receive explanatory dialogue about why the query is (not) accepted under certain/ credulous/ grounded semantics. The Darg system is built based on the SAF framework. At the first step of building the Darg system, we provide graphical representation of explanatory dialogues, i.e., dialogue trees.
This is a Java implementation.
